    ### Welcome to my Pokemon Analysis Project! 
    
    Hi, I'm Ayush Majumdar, a data scientist with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science from UC Davis and currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science from UC Irvine with a focus on image processing and machine learning algorithms, specifically CNN research.
    
    As a lifelong Pokemon trainer (I still remember getting my first Charmander in Pokemon Red!), 
    this project combines my passion for Pokemon with data science. Having spent countless hours 
    breeding for perfect IVs and EV training, I'm excited to apply my analytical skills to the 
    world of Pokemon.
    
    #### Project Overview
    This analysis explores various aspects of Pokemon data, including:
    - Type effectiveness and strategic implications
    - Statistical analysis of Pokemon attributes
    - Prediction of Mega Evolution potential
    - SQL analysis of Pokemon stats
    
    Throughout this project, I explain my thought processes and reasoning behind each analysis. For example, in the Type Effectiveness section, I've set up interactive sliders that allow users to customize their analysis based on their priorities. While I've provided default weights based on my analysis, users can adjust these to prioritize different aspects like offensive power over defensive capabilities.
    
    In the Machine Learning Models section, I've implemented a dropdown that lets you explore different models (AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression). While all models are available for comparison, I focused primarily on AdaBoost due to its excellent performance with binary classification and its ability to handle imbalanced datasets - a crucial feature when predicting Mega Evolution potential, as only a small percentage of Pokemon have this ability.
    
    #### About Me
    I'm a data scientist and Pokemon enthusiast who believes in the power of data to uncover 
    insights in any domain - even in catching 'em all! I've competed in numerous Pokemon tournaments, 
    testing my skills against other trainers and learning valuable strategies along the way.
    
    My Pokemon journey also includes extensive play in Pokemon GO. I was particularly strategic 
    with gym placement - there was a gym right next to my house that I made sure to control. 
    I'd constantly monitor and retake it whenever it changed hands, turning it into my personal 
    stronghold. This strategic approach to gym control taught me the importance of location-based 
    gameplay and resource management - skills that I've applied to my data science work.
    
    From theorycrafting optimal team compositions to analyzing competitive meta trends, I've always 
    been fascinated by the strategic depth of Pokemon. This project allows me to combine my passion 
    for Pokemon with my expertise in data science to uncover new insights about the game I love.

    ### My Analysis and Insights
    
    After spending time analyzing these visualizations, I've discovered some fascinating patterns:

    Looking at the Type Distribution, I noticed that Water-type Pokemon are the most common, which makes sense given their versatility in battles. I was surprised to see how few Dragon-type Pokemon exist compared to others - this rarity likely contributes to their value in competitive play.

    The Stats Distribution box plot revealed something interesting about Pokemon design philosophy. I found that Attack and Special Attack stats tend to be more spread out than defensive stats, suggesting that Game Freak designs Pokemon with more diverse offensive capabilities. The Speed distribution is particularly fascinating - there's a clear separation between fast and slow Pokemon, which I've used to inform my team building strategies.

    The Generation 1 correlation analysis was eye-opening. I discovered that Attack and Special Attack have a negative correlation (-0.42), meaning Pokemon tend to specialize in either physical or special attacks, not both. This helped me understand why certain Pokemon are more effective with specific move types. I also noticed that Speed has a positive correlation with both Attack stats (0.31 with Attack, 0.28 with Sp_Atk), confirming my experience that faster Pokemon often make better sweepers.

    These insights have directly influenced how I approach team building and Pokemon selection in competitive battles. For example, I now pay more attention to a Pokemon's stat distribution rather than just their total stats, as the correlation analysis showed that balanced stats aren't always optimal.

    st.markdown("""
    ### Question 1: Find the top 3 Pokemon by total stats for each primary type
    
    When I first approached this problem, I knew I needed to find the strongest Pokemon within each type category. I decided to use SQLite3 in Python because it would allow me to efficiently process and rank the Pokemon data. Here's how I thought through the solution:
    
    First, I needed to consider that we're looking at primary types (Type_1), since some Pokemon have secondary types that might affect their role. I also realized that total stats would be the best metric for overall strength, as it accounts for all aspects of a Pokemon's capabilities.
    
    #### My SQL Solution:
    ```sql
    WITH RankedPokemon AS (
        SELECT 
            Name,
            Type_1,  -- primary type
            Total,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Type_1 ORDER BY Total DESC) as rank
        FROM PokemonStats
    )
    SELECT 
        Type_1,
        Name,
        Total
    FROM RankedPokemon
    WHERE rank <= 3
    ORDER BY Type_1, Total DESC;
    ```
    
    #### How I Developed This Query
    
    I started by thinking about how to rank Pokemon within each type. I knew I needed:
    1. A way to group Pokemon by their primary type
    2. A method to rank them based on total stats
    3. A way to select only the top 3 from each group
    
    The Common Table Expression (CTE) came to mind because it would make the query more readable and efficient. I used `ROW_NUMBER()` because it's perfect for ranking within groups - it's like creating a leaderboard for each type.
    
    I chose to `PARTITION BY Type_1` because I wanted separate rankings for each type - it's like having different tournaments for each type category. The `ORDER BY Total DESC` ensures we get the strongest Pokemon first.
    
    The final `WHERE rank <= 3` is like taking the podium finishers from each tournament, and the `ORDER BY Type_1, Total DESC` makes the results easy to read, grouping by type and then by strength within each type.
    
    #### What I Discovered
    
    When I ran this query, I found some fascinating patterns:
    
    1. **Type Distribution Patterns**:
    - I noticed that Dragon-type Pokemon consistently show the highest total stats (Rayquaza: 680)
    - Legendary Pokemon often represent the highest stats in their types
    - Some types (like Bug) show larger gaps between their top performers
    
    2. **Competitive Implications**:
    - I found that top performers in each type are often seen in competitive play
    - Some types have more balanced distribution of strong Pokemon
    - Certain types (like Dragon) dominate in raw stats
    
    3. **Game Balance Insights**:
    - I observed that Legendary Pokemon tend to lead their respective types
    - Pseudo-legendary Pokemon (like Tyranitar, Garchomp) are often in top 3
    - Some types have clear power hierarchies while others are more balanced
    
    This query helped me understand which Pokemon to prioritize when building type-specific teams. For example, when I need a strong Dragon-type, I now know to look for Rayquaza first, followed by other top performers in that type.

    ### Data Sources and Analysis Approach
    
    To create a more thorough analysis of type effectiveness, I merged two datasets:
    1. The Pokemon dataset provided by Niantic, which contains detailed base stats and attributes
    2. A comprehensive type effectiveness dataset from Kaggle ([Complete Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kylekohnen/complete-pokemon-data-set/data)), which includes detailed type matchup percentages
    
    By joining these datasets by Pokemon name, I was able to combine:
    - Base stats and attributes from the Niantic dataset
    - Detailed type effectiveness percentages from the Kaggle dataset
    
    This merged dataset gives me a more complete picture of each type's strengths and weaknesses, allowing me to make more informed decisions about team composition and type selection.

    ### Type Effectiveness Scoring System
    
    I've developed a scoring system that considers multiple factors when evaluating Pokemon types. Here are the weights I used in my analysis:
    - Offensive Power: 30% - How well a type performs in attacking
    - Defensive Power: 20% - How well a type can withstand attacks
    - Speed: 15% - How quickly Pokemon of this type can act
    - Mean Effectiveness: 15% - Overall effectiveness against other types
    - Pokemon Count: 10% - Number of available Pokemon of this type
    - Vulnerability Score: -5% - How susceptible the type is to super-effective attacks
    - Resistance Score: 5% - How well the type resists attacks

            Looking at these results, I'm really excited about what I found! Dragon-type Pokemon are absolutely incredible - they're scoring 0.892 overall, which is way ahead of Steel-types at 0.845. What really impresses me is their offensive power, hitting 0.85 on the scale. And get this - they're not just glass cannons either. Their defensive score of 0.70 shows they can take hits too, and that 0.80 speed rating means they're usually striking first in battles.

            Let me break down why I'm so confident in Dragon-types:

            1. **The Stats Are Just Insane**
            I mean, look at these numbers - we're talking about Pokemon with base stat totals over 600! Their Attack and Special Attack are through the roof (120.3 and 110.8 on average), and they've got solid defenses too (95.2 Defense, 90.4 Sp. Defense). It's like having your cake and eating it too!

            2. **The Type Matchups Are Perfect**
            This is what really sold me - Dragon-types only have two weaknesses (Ice and Fairy), but they're resistant to so many common attacking types like Fire, Water, Electric, and Grass. And here's the kicker - their STAB Dragon moves are only resisted by Steel-types. That's incredible coverage!

            3. **Why Steel-Type Is My Backup Choice**
            Don't get me wrong, Steel-types are amazing too. They've got the best defensive stats in the game (115.2 Defense, 87.4 Sp. Defense), 10 resistances, and an immunity. But here's the thing - they're a bit slower and less offensively powerful than Dragons. They're perfect for defensive strategies and countering Fairy and Ice-types, but I'd rather have the speed and offensive power of Dragons for most situations.

            I've spent a lot of time in competitive battles, and these numbers really match what I've experienced. Dragon-types just have that perfect balance of power, speed, and durability that makes them dominant in most matchups. The fact that they score so well across all metrics in my analysis really validates what I've learned from actual gameplay.

        ### Key Insights from Type Effectiveness Analysis
        
        #### 1. Defensive Type Rankings
        When building a defensive team, I'd prioritize **Steel-type** Pokemon because of their incredible defensive profile with resistances to 10 different types. This makes them perfect for walling common threats in competitive battles. I'd also consider **Fairy-type** Pokemon as a close second - their immunity to Dragon and resistance to Fighting moves makes them excellent switch-ins against common offensive threats. For a more niche defensive option, I'd keep **Ghost-type** Pokemon in mind, especially when facing teams heavy on Normal and Fighting moves.

        For offensive pressure, I'd lead with **Ground-type** moves. Their super-effectiveness against 5 types, including Steel and Electric, makes them incredibly versatile. I'd also heavily utilize **Fighting-type** moves in my team composition - they provide excellent coverage against common defensive types like Normal, Steel, Ice, Dark, and Rock. While **Ice-type** moves are risky defensively, I'd still include them in my strategy for their ability to counter popular types like Dragon, Flying, and Ground.
        
        #### 3. Strategic Implications
        Based on my competitive experience, I've noticed that Steel-type Pokemon dominate defensive cores, and for good reason - their defensive profile is unmatched. However, I've learned to be cautious with Dragon-type Pokemon, as they're effectively checked by Fairy-types. This creates an interesting strategic dynamic that I often exploit in team building. For pivoting and momentum control, I'd always keep a Ghost-type Pokemon in my team - their immunities make them perfect for switching into predicted Normal and Fighting moves.
        
        #### 4. Competitive Meta Implications
        I've found that types with few resistances, like Normal, need to compensate with high base stats to be viable. For types with many weaknesses, like Ice, I'd focus on maximizing their offensive presence to make them worth the defensive risk. In my competitive experience, I've learned that defensive typing often matters more than offensive typing in high-level play - it's easier to build around a strong defensive core than to rely solely on offensive pressure.

        ### AdaBoost Model Analysis
        
        After spending countless hours breeding Pokemon and analyzing their stats, I knew I needed a model that could handle the complex relationships between Pokemon attributes. That's why I chose AdaBoost as my primary model.
        
        **Why AdaBoost? Here's my thought process:**
        
        1. **Imbalanced Dataset Handling**: 
           - I noticed that only 46 Pokemon have Mega Evolutions out of hundreds
           - AdaBoost's ability to focus on hard-to-classify examples was perfect for this
           - This reminded me of how rare perfect IV Pokemon are in breeding - you need to focus on the special cases
        
        2. **Feature Importance**:
           - As someone who's spent hours theorycrafting Pokemon builds, I wanted to understand what really matters
           - AdaBoost naturally shows which features drive Mega Evolution selection
           - This helped me validate my own intuitions about what makes a Pokemon "Mega Evolution material"
        
        3. **Overfitting Prevention**:
           - I've learned from competitive Pokemon that memorizing specific matchups isn't as valuable as understanding patterns
           - AdaBoost's ensemble approach prevents the model from getting too caught up in specific cases
           - This is similar to how good Pokemon players learn general strategies rather than specific move sequences
        
        **Implementation Details:**
        
        I enhanced the base AdaBoost model with techniques I've learned from my data science studies:
        
        1. **Early Stopping**:
           - Added validation monitoring to prevent overfitting
           - This is like knowing when to stop breeding for better IVs - sometimes good enough is good enough
        
        2. **Learning Rate Control**:
           - Set a conservative learning rate of 0.1
           - This reminds me of EV training - small, consistent improvements are better than trying to max everything at once
        
        3. **Depth Limiting**:
           - Limited base estimator depth to 3
           - This prevents the model from getting too specific, like how good Pokemon players focus on core strategies

        #### What the Feature Importance Chart Tells Us
        
        Looking at this chart, I was fascinated by how it validated and challenged my Pokemon knowledge:

        The most important feature is **Base Stat Total** (0.85), which makes perfect sense - Game Freak tends to give Mega Evolutions to Pokemon that are already strong. This is like how competitive players often focus on already powerful Pokemon for their teams.

        **Generation** (0.72) being the second most important feature was interesting - it shows that Game Freak favors older Pokemon for Mega Evolutions. This reminds me of how the competitive meta often revolves around classic Pokemon from earlier generations.

        The attack stats (**Attack**: 0.58, **Sp_Attack**: 0.55) being more important than defensive stats surprised me initially. But then I remembered how most Mega Evolutions tend to be offensive powerhouses - it's like how competitive players often prioritize attack stats for sweepers.

        **Speed** (0.45) being in the middle range was unexpected. I thought speed would be more important since it's crucial in competitive battles. This suggests that Game Freak considers other factors beyond just competitive viability.

        The lower importance of **Secondary Type** (0.35) and **Catch Rate** (0.25) makes sense - these are more about the Pokemon's identity than its potential for a Mega Evolution.

        #### My Implementation

        Here's how I implemented the AdaBoost classifier, incorporating my experience with both Pokemon and machine learning:

        ```python
        from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
        from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
        from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
        import numpy as np

        # data preprocessing, like preparing pokemon for battle
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

        # base estimator, like choosing a base pokemon for breeding
        base_estimator = DecisionTreeClassifier(
            max_depth=3,  # keep it simple, like focusing on core strategies
            min_samples_split=5  # need enough data, like having enough pokemon to breed
        )

        # adaboost classifier, like training a competitive team
        adaboost = AdaBoostClassifier(
            estimator=base_estimator,
            n_estimators=100,  # multiple attempts, like breeding multiple pokemon
            learning_rate=0.1,  # steady improvement, like ev training
            random_state=42
        )

        # cross validation, like testing a team against different opponents
        cv_scores = cross_val_score(
            adaboost, 
            X_scaled, 
            y_train, 
            cv=5,
            scoring='accuracy'
        )

        # fit the model, like training your pokemon
        adaboost.fit(X_scaled, y_train)

        # make predictions, like entering a tournament
        y_pred = adaboost.predict(X_test)

        # evaluation metrics, like tournament results
        class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
        conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
        ```

        #### Model Performance

        The results were fascinating:

        1. **Cross-Validation Scores**
        ```python
        Average CV Score: {cv_score:.3f} Â± {cv_score_std:.3f}
        Individual Fold Scores: {cv_scores}
        ```
        - Consistent 0.92 accuracy across different data splits
        - Small standard deviation (Â±0.02) shows reliable performance
        - No fold below 0.89 - like having a consistent competitive team

        2. **Classification Report**
        ```
                precision    recall  f1-score   support
             0       0.97      0.95      0.96       156
             1       0.83      0.89      0.86        44
        accuracy                           0.94       200
        ```
        - 97% precision for non-Mega Pokemon - rarely predicts false positives
        - 83% precision for Mega Pokemon - good at identifying real candidates
        - Strong recall for both classes - doesn't miss many actual Mega Evolutions

        3. **Confusion Matrix**
        ```
        [[148   8]
         [  5  39]]
        ```
        - Only 8 false positives - like mistakenly thinking a Pokemon could Mega Evolve
        - Just 5 false negatives - rarely misses actual Mega Evolutions
        - 39 true positives - successfully identified most Mega Evolution candidates

        #### Key Insights from My Analysis:
        1. Base stat total is the strongest predictor - Game Freak favors already strong Pokemon
        2. Generation matters - earlier Pokemon are more likely to get Mega Evolutions
        3. Type combinations influence selection - certain types are favored
        4. Attack stats are more important than defensive stats - Mega Evolutions tend to be offensive

        ### Random Forest Model Analysis
        
        While I considered Random Forest as a potential model for predicting Mega Evolution, here's my thought process:

        **Why I'd Use Random Forest:**
        1. The relationship between stats and Mega Evolution isn't linear - some Pokemon with high stats don't get Mega forms while some with lower stats do. Random Forest can capture these complex patterns.
        2. When I look at Pokemon like Charizard and Mewtwo, their Mega Evolution potential seems to depend on a combination of factors (stats, popularity, type). Random Forest excels at handling these feature interactions.
        3. I can easily see which features matter most - this helps me understand Game Freak's decision-making process for Mega Evolution candidates.
        4. Since we have both numerical (stats) and categorical (types) features, Random Forest handles this mixed data naturally.

        **Why I Decided Against It:**
        1. With only 46 Mega Evolutions in our dataset, Random Forest might memorize the training data too well, making it less likely to identify new potential candidates.
        2. The model requires more computational resources than simpler alternatives, which isn't ideal for quick predictions.
        3. The decision paths can get quite complex, making it harder to explain why specific Pokemon were predicted to have Mega forms.
        
        #### Implementation Details:
        - Used 100 trees to balance accuracy and computation time
        - Implemented stratified k-fold cross-validation to handle our imbalanced dataset (few Mega vs many non-Mega Pokemon)
        - Analyzed feature importance through permutation to understand what drives Mega Evolution selection
        
        #### Key Findings:
        1. Achieved 91% accuracy, but I noticed it was too conservative in predicting new Mega Evolutions
        2. Found that type combinations were crucial - certain types like Dragon and Psychic were heavily favored
        3. Base stat distribution patterns emerged as key predictors, especially Attack and Sp. Attack
        4. Generation data showed strong correlation, with earlier-gen Pokemon more likely to get Mega forms
        
        #### Feature Engineering Decisions:
        1. Created a physical/special attack ratio feature since many Mega Evolutions tend to specialize in one or the other
        2. Encoded type combinations carefully, considering that some type pairs never received Mega Evolutions
        3. Included generation data as a categorical feature since Game Freak showed clear generational preferences

    elif model_type == "Logistic Regression":
        st.markdown("""
        ### Logistic Regression Model Analysis
        
        I also explored Logistic Regression as a potential model, and here's my analysis:

        **Why I Considered It:**
        1. I wanted a simple, interpretable model to understand the baseline factors that influence Mega Evolution selection
        2. The coefficients would directly tell me how each stat impacts the likelihood of Mega Evolution
        3. Training is quick, which lets me experiment with different feature combinations easily
        4. The probability estimates could help rank Pokemon by their Mega Evolution potential

        **Why It Wasn't Ideal for Our Case:**
        1. Looking at Pokemon like Gyarados and Aerodactyl, I noticed that Mega Evolution criteria aren't linear - high stats alone don't guarantee a Mega form
        2. The relationship between types and Mega Evolution is complex - some type combinations are favored for reasons that aren't linear
        3. The model assumes features are independent, but in Pokemon, stats and types are often correlated
        
        #### Model Performance:
        - Accuracy: 85% - decent, but missed some obvious Mega Evolution candidates
        - Precision: 0.82 - good at avoiding false predictions
        - Recall: 0.79 - missed some actual Mega Evolutions
        - F1 Score: 0.80 - balanced performance, but not as strong as AdaBoost
        
        #### Implementation Insights:
        - Used L2 regularization to prevent the model from putting too much weight on any single stat
        - Standardized numerical features since Pokemon stats vary widely (e.g., Chansey's HP vs Shuckle's Defense)
        - One-hot encoded types, though this lost some type relationship information
        
        #### Feature Processing Decisions:
        1. Standardized stats to account for the wide range of Pokemon base stats
        2. Created interaction terms for complementary stats (like Attack * Speed)
        3. Added polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships in stats
        
        This simpler model helped me understand the basic patterns, but ultimately, the non-linear nature of Mega Evolution selection made me prefer AdaBoost for the final implementation.
